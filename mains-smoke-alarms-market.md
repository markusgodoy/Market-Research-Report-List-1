<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mains Smoke Alarms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric Smoke Alarms</li><li>Ionization Smoke Alarms</li><li>Combination Smoke Alarms</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mains smoke alarms are categorized into three types: photoelectric smoke alarms, ionization smoke alarms, and combination smoke alarms. Photoelectric smoke alarms use a beam of light to detect smoke particles, making them effective at detecting smoldering fires. Ionization smoke alarms, on the other hand, use a small amount of radioactive material to ionize the air inside the alarm and detect smoke particles from fast-flaming fires. Combination smoke alarms combine both photoelectric and ionization technologies to provide dual detection capabilities, making them suitable for detecting a wide range of fire types.</p></p>
