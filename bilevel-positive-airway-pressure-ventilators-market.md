<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pressure BiPAP Device</li><li>Auto Adjusting BiPAP Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) ventilators are designed to help patients with breathing difficulties. The fixed pressure BiPAP device delivers a consistent pressure level throughout the treatment, suitable for patients with a stable breathing pattern. On the other hand, the auto-adjusting BiPAP device constantly monitors the patient's breathing and automatically adjusts the pressure level accordingly for more personalized treatment. Both types of BiPAP devices aim to ensure proper ventilation and improve the patient's breathing, but they differ in the approach used to deliver the necessary airway pressure.</p></p>
