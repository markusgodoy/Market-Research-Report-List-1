<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synchronous Electric Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Excited Synchronous Electric Motors</li><li>Non-Excited Synchronous Electric Motors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synchronous electric motors are classified into two main types: DC excited synchronous electric motors and non-excited synchronous electric motors. DC excited motors use a Direct Current (DC) power supply to create a magnetic field in the rotor, resulting in synchronous rotation. Non-excited motors, on the other hand, do not require an external power source and generate the magnetic field within the rotor itself. Both types are widely used in various industries for applications that require precise speed control and high efficiency.</p></p>
