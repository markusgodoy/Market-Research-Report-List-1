<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microparticle Injectables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Degradable</li><li>Non-Degradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microparticle injectables are a type of drug delivery system that involves the use of tiny particles to deliver medications to specific areas of the body. These particles come in two main types: degradable and non-degradable. Degradable microparticles are designed to break down over time, releasing the medication gradually. This allows for sustained drug release and reduces the need for frequent injections. Non-degradable microparticles, on the other hand, remain intact within the body and provide a controlled and localized release of the medication. Both types have their own advantages and applications in the pharmaceutical market.</p></p>
