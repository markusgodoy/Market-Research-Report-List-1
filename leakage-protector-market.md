<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leakage Protector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Voltage Type</li><li>Current Type</li><li>Pulse Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A leakage protector, also known as a circuit breaker, is a device used to protect against electric shocks and fire due to electrical leakage in home appliances. There are three common types of leakage protectors in the market. The voltage type is sensitive to high voltage fluctuations and disconnects the supply when voltage exceeds the set limit. The current type detects excessive current flow and cuts off supply accordingly. The pulse type is a combination of both voltage and current protection, which disconnects the supply in case of either voltage or current anomalies.</p></p>
