<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underfill Dispenser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capillary Flow Underfill</li><li>No Flow Underfill</li><li>Molded Underfill</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The underfill dispenser market is divided into three types: capillary flow underfill, no flow underfill, and molded underfill. Capillary flow underfill is a type of adhesive that is applied to a electronic component and flows into the gaps by capillary action. No flow underfill is a low-viscosity liquid material that does not flow, ensuring that the component remains fixed in place. Molded underfill is a technique where the underfill material is introduced during the molding process, providing protection and enhancing the mechanical strength of the electronic component.</p></p>
