<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dedusting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central Dedusting System</li><li>Independent Dust Collector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dedusting systems refer to equipment designed to remove dust and other airborne particles from industrial processes. Central dedusting systems are centralized units that connect multiple dust-producing machinery to a single dust collector. This type ensures efficient and cost-effective removal of dust in large industrial operations. On the other hand, independent dust collectors are standalone units that are directly connected to individual machines or workstations. They provide localized filtration and are suitable for smaller-scale operations or areas where central systems are not practical. Both types aim to improve air quality and protect workers' health.</p></p>
