<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Waterproof Coating</li><li>Dry Waterproof Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Powder waterproof coating market offers two main types: Liquid Waterproof Coating and Dry Waterproof Coating. Liquid waterproof coatings are ready-to-use products that can be directly applied to the surface, forming a protective waterproof layer once dried. On the other hand, Dry waterproof coatings come in powder form and require mixing with water before application. They offer more flexibility in terms of application thickness and are more cost-effective compared to liquid coatings. Both types provide effective waterproofing solutions for various surfaces.</p></p>
