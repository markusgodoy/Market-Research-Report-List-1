<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Buzzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezo Buzzers</li><li>Magnetic Buzzers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive buzzer market consists of two main types: piezo buzzers and magnetic buzzers. Piezo buzzers generate sound through a piezoelectric material that vibrates when an electrical current is applied. They offer high sound intensity and a wide frequency range. Magnetic buzzers, on the other hand, produce sound using a coil and a magnet. When an electrical signal passes through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that attracts the magnet, causing it to vibrate and produce sound. Both types of buzzers are commonly used in automotive applications for various purposes such as driver alerts and warning signals.</p></p>
