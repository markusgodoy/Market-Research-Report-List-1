<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Elbow Fitting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>90° Angle</li><li>45° Angle</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Elbow Fitting market is segmented into three types based on the angle of the fitting. The first type is the 90° Angle fitting, which provides a right angle turn in the pneumatic system. This type of fitting is commonly used when the direction of flow needs to be changed by 90 degrees. The second type is the 45° Angle fitting, which offers a more gradual turn of 45 degrees. This fitting is suitable when a lesser change in direction is required. Lastly, the market also includes fittings categorized as "Others," which encompasses all fittings that do not fall into the 90° or 45° angle types.</p></p>
