<p><strong>The Foam Dressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adhesive Foam Dressing</li><li>Non-Adhesive Foam Dressing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foam dressings are a type of wound dressing used to promote healing and protect wounds. Adhesive foam dressings have an adhesive border that sticks to the surrounding skin, creating a secure seal. They are beneficial for wounds with moderate to heavy exudate. Non-adhesive foam dressings, on the other hand, do not have an adhesive border. They are often used for wounds with little to no exudate and can be held in place by a secondary dressing or tape. Both types of foam dressings provide a moist environment for wound healing and prevent infection.</p></p>
