<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Bike Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clincher Bike Tyres</li><li>Tubular Bike Tyres</li><li>Tubeless Bike Tyres</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Road bike tires come in three different types: clincher, tubular, and tubeless. Clincher bike tires are the most common and have an outer tire that clinches onto the rim with the help of an inner tube. Tubular bike tires are lighter and more expensive, where the entire tire is sewn around the tube, and then glued onto the rim. Tubeless bike tires, on the other hand, are airtight and do not require an inner tube, reducing the chances of flat tires. Each type has its own advantages and is preferred based on the rider's needs and preferences.</p></p>
