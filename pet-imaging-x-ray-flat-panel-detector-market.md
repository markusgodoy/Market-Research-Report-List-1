<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pet Imaging X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pet Imaging X-ray Flat Panel Detectors are used in medical imaging to capture X-ray images. There are two types of detectors available: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a scintillator material that converts X-rays into visible light, which is then detected by a photodiode. In contrast, direct conversion detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical charges by using a semiconductor material like amorphous selenium. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of image quality, cost, and sensitivity to low radiation levels.</p></p>
