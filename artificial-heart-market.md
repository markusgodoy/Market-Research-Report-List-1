<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Heart market comprises two main types: Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) and Total Artificial Heart. VAD is a mechanical pump that assists the weakened heart in pumping blood throughout the body. It can be used as a short-term solution, as a bridge to a heart transplant, or as a lifelong treatment for patients with heart failure. On the other hand, the Total Artificial Heart is a surgical option that replaces the human heart entirely. It is typically used as a temporary measure until a suitable donor heart becomes available for transplantation.</p></p>
