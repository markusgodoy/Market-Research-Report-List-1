<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Control System</li><li>Closed Loop Control System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chemical control systems consist of various types such as open loop control system and closed loop control system. In an open loop control system, the output is not considered to adjust or regulate the system's operation. This means that there is no feedback loop to monitor and correct deviations. On the other hand, in a closed loop control system, the output is continuously compared with the desired value, and adjustments are made accordingly to maintain stability and accuracy. This feedback loop ensures better control over the system's functioning.</p></p>
