<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Curtains Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Re-circulating Air Curtains</li><li>Non-re-circulating Air Curtains</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air curtains are devices installed above entryways to create a barrier between two different environments by using a downward flow of air. Re-circulating air curtains are designed to recirculate indoor air, making them energy efficient and suitable for smaller spaces. On the other hand, non-re-circulating air curtains draw air from outside, resulting in a constant flow of fresh air. These are typically used in larger spaces with higher levels of pollution or when outdoor air quality needs to be maintained. Both types are used to control temperature, prevent air infiltration, and reduce energy consumption.</p></p>
