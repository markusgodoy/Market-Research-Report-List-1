<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The T-Cell Immunotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CAR-T</li><li>TCR</li><li>TIL Therapies</li></ul></p>
<p><p>T-cell immunotherapy is an emerging field in cancer treatment that utilizes the patient's own T-cells to target and destroy cancer cells. There are three main types of T-cell immunotherapies: CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell) therapy modifies T-cells to express a specific receptor, allowing them to recognize and attack cancer cells; TCR (T-cell Receptor) therapy modifies T-cells to recognize cancer-specific antigens presented on the surface of tumor cells; TIL (Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte) therapy involves isolating T-cells from tumors, activating and expanding them in the laboratory, and then infusing them back into the patient to target the tumor.</p></p>
