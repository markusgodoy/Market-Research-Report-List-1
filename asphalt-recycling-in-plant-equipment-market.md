<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Recycling In-plant Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Mix Regeneration</li><li>Cold Mix Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asphalt recycling in-plant equipment market includes two major types: Hot Mix Regeneration and Cold Mix Regeneration. Hot Mix Regeneration involves heating the reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) to bring it back to a workable state and then mixing it with new materials to produce a hot asphalt mix. On the other hand, Cold Mix Regeneration involves combining the RAP with emulsified or foamed asphalt at ambient or lower temperatures, eliminating the need for heating. These processes allow for sustainable and cost-effective recycling of old asphalt materials in road construction projects.</p></p>
