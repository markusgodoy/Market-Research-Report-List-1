<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Transmission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Transmission System</li><li>Automatic Transmission System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus transmission system market consists of two main types: manual transmission system and automatic transmission system. In a manual transmission system, the driver manually selects and engages the gears using the clutch pedal and gear shift. This system is cost-effective and offers better control over the vehicle's acceleration. On the other hand, in an automatic transmission system, the gears are automatically selected and engaged based on the vehicle's speed and load, eliminating the need for manual gear shifting. This system provides convenience and smoother gear transitions for the driver.</p></p>
