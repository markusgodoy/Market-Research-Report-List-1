<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Intervention Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal intervention refers to medical procedures performed on the spine to treat various conditions. The market is divided into two types: open surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Open surgery involves making a large incision to access the spine, allowing surgeons to directly view and treat the affected area. On the other hand, minimally invasive surgery involves making small incisions and using specialized instruments and imaging technology to perform the procedure. Minimally invasive surgery typically results in less pain, shorter recovery time, and lower risk of complications compared to open surgery.</p></p>
