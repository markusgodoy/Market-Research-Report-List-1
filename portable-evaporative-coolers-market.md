<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Evaporative Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combined Flow</li><li>Parallel Flow</li><li>Counter Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable evaporative coolers are available in three different market types: combined flow, parallel flow, and counter flow. Combined flow coolers have air and water traveling in the same direction, resulting in a shorter cooling path and higher saturation efficiency. Parallel flow coolers have air and water flowing in opposite directions, which enhances cooling efficiency by increasing the water evaporation rate. Counter flow coolers have air and water moving in opposite directions but at different angles, maximizing the cooling effect by allowing efficient heat transfer between the air and water streams.</p></p>
