<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fiber Tissue Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Laid Process</li><li>Dry-Laid Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glass fiber tissue is produced through either the wet-laid process or the dry-laid process. In the wet-laid process, glass fibers are dispersed in water and then formed into a continuous sheet through filtration. This method allows for the production of fine, uniform fibers, resulting in a tissue with high strength and porosity. On the other hand, the dry-laid process involves the random deposition of individual glass fibers onto a moving belt, which are then bonded together. This process results in a tissue with excellent elongation and flexibility, making it suitable for applications requiring such characteristics.</p></p>
