<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terrestrial Laser Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Based Scanners</li><li>Time-Of-Flight Scanners</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Terrestrial laser scanners are used for capturing three-dimensional data of terrestrial objects or surfaces. Phase-based scanners use the principle of light interference to measure distance and create a high-resolution point cloud. They provide accurate measurements and are suitable for capturing detailed and complex objects. On the other hand, time-of-flight scanners calculate the time taken by a laser pulse to travel to the target and back, allowing for distance measurement. They are faster at capturing data but may have reduced accuracy compared to phase-based scanners.</p></p>
